# Stacklands

## Where is the options page?
You can configure your randomization options on the [Stacklands Player Options](../player-options) page.

## What does randomization do to this game?
In this Stacklands randomizer, all `Booster Packs` and `Ideas` are randomized and will be received in a non-standard order. `Booster Packs` cannot be purchased until you have received that specific booster pack as an item. For example, you cannot purchase booster packs from `Humble Beginnings` until you have first received the `Humble Beginnings Booster Pack` item from the MultiWorld. **Ideas** cannot be crafted until you have received that specific idea as an item. For example, you cannot craft a **House** until you have first received the `Idea: House` item from the MultiWorld.

## What is the goal of Stacklands when randomized?
The currently available goals of this Stacklands randomizer are:
- Beat one random boss from your selected boards.
- Beat _all_ bosses from your selected boards.
Both the goal and the available vanilla boards _(Mainland, Dark Forest and The Island)_ for your session can be configured in the options page.

### PLEASE NOTE
This mod currently requires the goal to be triggered manually due to a library conflict that causes the game to crash when sending the goal automatically. A fix is being worked on, so this is a temporary measure until it is resolved. Once you have completed your goal, go back to `Mods -> Archipelago Randomizer` and click `Send Goal`. The game will quickly re-start and the goal should be set successfully. _(It will only allow you to send once the goal has been reached.)_

## Which items can be in another player's world?
The currently available items for this Stacklands randomizer are:

- **Booster Packs** -> Unlocks booster packs to be able to be purchased.
- **Ideas** -> Unlocks the ability to craft a card.
- **Board Expansions** -> Increase the board size and card limit of the board. _(Configurable in the options page)_
- **Custom Booster Packs** -> Archipelago-specific "filler" booster packs that contain an assortment of random items.
- **Traps** -> Such as spawning Mobs, Strange Portals or forcing you to sell cards. _(Configurable in the options page)_

**Booster Packs** and the majority of **Ideas** are considered as 'required' for progression. The rest are considered either useful, junk or traps.

## What does another world's item look like in Stacklands?
Items from other worlds do not take any visible appearance, but are found by completing each in-game quest in the quest list. When a quest is completed, a notification will pop up telling you which item was found and to whom it belongs.

All quests from the vanilla game are "checks" along with some additional custom quests _(such as cooking one of each food, crafting one of each equipment, killing one of each Mob etc.)_ that can be configured via the options page.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
When you receive an item from the MultiWorld, it is immediately spawned to the board along with a notification to tell you which item you received and who sent it. However, some items are board-specific _(such as Booster Pack items that are specific to 'The Island' or the 'Mainland Board Expansion' item)_. so these items will spawn to their respective board even if you are not currently playing on that board, so it may look like the item has not appeared but the notification will alert you and the item will be waiting for you when you switch boards.

## How many items can I find or receive in my world?
There are the following amount of maximum Location Checks available for each board:
- **Mainland** -> Up to **141** Locations _(with all 'Sanity' locations enabled)_
- **Dark Forest** -> Up to **11** Locations _(with all 'Sanity' Locations enabled)_
- **The Island** -> Up to **88** Locations _(with all 'Sanity' Locations enabled)_
As there are always the same amount of items in your item pool as you have locations, this means you could have up to a current maximum of **240 Items** to find/receive in your world, depending on your configuration settings.
